title: Rails Project (Part 1)
---

In this series, I'm going to build a fully working Ruby on Rails site and host it on Heroku.  We'll be using test-driven development practices and writing rspec tests before each feature.  We'll incorporate a CI/CD chain through [Codeship](http://www.codeship.com/) and host the project on [Bitbucket](http://www.bitbucket.org/).
